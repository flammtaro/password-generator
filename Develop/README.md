# password-generator-hw

## Description
- The goal of this project was to create a password generator using pop-up prompts, within a certain size (8 - 128 characters), selectable character types, and ultimately generate the password randomly from these factors. 

- I built this project in order to better understand how to create pop-up functions in Javascript, as well as use For Loops and Array implementation

- What I learned on this project is that array outputs when converted to strings will output the commas between the variables. This took a lot of research to ultimately use the Join command to remove or replace the commas. Also, the importance of understanding how the JS file and the HTML file ultimately communicate, and change each other's variables. 

## Installation
To install this project, you need to:
-Download the code from the projects GitHub: https://github.com/flammtaro/password-generator
-Open the code in Visual Studio Code

## Usage
This code contains the HTML and CSS of the current version of my portfolio website. An image of the current version of the website can be seen here: ![side by side code](assets/passwordgenerator.png). The program itself can be used to come up with different password variations for use in any account creation program.
